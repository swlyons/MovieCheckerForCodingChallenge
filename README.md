# MovieCheckerForCodingChallenge

So first off I don't have a IDE to use so I installed the IntelliJ Community Edition.
I also didn't have Node.js installed so I did that.
Since the backend is to be written in Node.js I clicked the Node.js icon on https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started
I see that it's saying that it'll provide an API key, so I'll get back to this once I've used Node.js to run something.
The install for Node.js finished and I see that choco, which installs right after installing Node.js, failed inside of my Windows Power Shell.
I do not know what choco is used for so it *might* not matter
However, IntelliJ can install a Node.js plugin and there's a good chance I'll be able to run it and run express through it so I'll go do that now.
I see that the Node.js plugin is only part of the Ultimate edition that I do not have. I could try the 30 day trial, but I'll first try with the Node.js that got installed, hopefully it doesn't need choco but we'll see.
Worst case scenario is I start over on my laptop which *might* work better.
I used npm and installed express, I'll need to clean all of this off this cpu later but not a big deal (just cause typically I don't code on this computer).
I opened up https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction just so that I can get something simple running.
Basic NodeJs "Hello World was a success"
Now have crying child on lap, I know it says uninterrupted work, but until she starts banging on they keyboard I should be fine (she wasn't there too long)
K, got the node.js and the express "Hello World!" working.
I briefed through the rest of the page and I vaguely recall using routes last time I was working with Node.js, and I think that's what I need, so I'll copy that piece of code over
I'll leave the examples in a folder called test-node in webservices
I see a new directory called node_modules, I'm just going to ignore it for now so that I can focus on the code challenge, if I was working though, normally I'd move it around and look up the best place to put it along with any security concerns.
